(Kanata)[https://github.com/jtroo/kanata/tree/v1.7.0] is a keyboard remapper that is available on Linux, MacOS and Windows.
It allows us to change the behaviour of our keyboards by remapping the keys and surcharge them with different behaviours.

1. Download kanata v1.7.0 into your system

3. Create the kanata service
4. Start the service so you can use kanata right away.
5. Enable the service so kanata run at startup
